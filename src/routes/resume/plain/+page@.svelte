		</p>
		<p>To whom this may concern.</p>
		<p>
			I am writing with enthusiasm to recommend Ryan Roga for a position in your establishment. As a
			classmate of Ryan's, I had the pleasure and opportunity to work alongside him in the web and
			mobile development program at the Vancouver Island University.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ryan is a motivated and fiery individual who cares deeply about his work and education.
			Throughout the classes I participated in with Ryan, he has demonstrated his passion,
			curiosity, intelligence, zealousness, approachability, and kindliness time and time again.
		</p>
		<p>
			During the program, Ryan recognized a need in the other students. He happily stepped into a
			role that should have been filled by the teacher and offered both group, and one-on-one
			tutoring sessions.
		</p>
		<p>
			As someone who took on the offer for his one-on-one tutoring sessions, I can easily say it was
			the best decision I have made during the duration of the program. Ryan took on my concerns and
			adapted his teaching technique to help me in a way where I could easily digest the mass amount
			of information that is JavaScript. Never did he make me feel like I was a burden for needing
			help or asking questions. He was patient and enthusiastic about the topic, and because of
			this, my dead enthusiasm was brought back, and I now feel more confident in my abilities to
			take on the upcoming challenges.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ryan is a strong “hands and head-on” individual whom I think would be an incredible addition
			to any company he becomes a part of; as he can offer the rare independent and entrepreneurial
			mindset that is not often paired with interpersonal-consideration.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you would like to speak further on Ryan's character or have further questions, please feel
			free to contact me by phone or email.
		</p>
		<p>
			All the best,<br />Lené Olenick
